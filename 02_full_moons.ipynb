moment of the full moon peak may or may not occur “at night” in whatever time zone you happen to be (or, for our purposes, wherever basketball games are being played), we need to come up with a reasonable window of time around the full moon peak in which a game might have transpired. \n","\n","### NCAA Final Four games tend to happen between 6 PM and 12 PM EST, so let's start with that as our baseline game window. We'll then add an 18-hour cushion on either side of the game time to account for the passage of any moon phase peak. This establishes a 42-hour window to capture tournament games near or during peak phases of the moon, and excludes games that occurred outside of those 42-hour windows.\n","\n","### Now that our window is defined, we'll use an *inner* join so that we only see games that match with our moon phase windows.
